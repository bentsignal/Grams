<h2>About the Project</h2>

Two of my friends really like playing each other in anagrams via iMessage. When you play on iMessage (GamePidgeon), one person plays, and then sends the game to the other person. The two players dont play the game at the same time. The sender must wait for the recipient to see it and play them back. I feel like this creates a disconnect, because the recipient may not see the game for hours, or even days. I thought it would be more fun if the players played against each other in real time, and could then see each others scores and word lists immediately after the game completes. Game pidgeon also only lets two people play each other at a time. Pretty lame. I set the max players to be 6 in the config, but in theory as many people as possible could play grams together!

This is not a very serious project. I thought of it while talking with the two previously mentioned friends late at night, and began developing it the next day on a whim. It is not meant to be scalable or played by others. The site is public, but I dont plan on promoting it anywhere. There are no private lobbies, so only one group of people can play at a time. The sole mission of this project was to have fun with my friends, which was definitely accomplished. I wasnt even planning on making the repo public, but I actually kinda like how it turned out so I figured why not add it to the collection.
